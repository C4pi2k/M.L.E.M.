# M.L.E.M
## WTF is M.L.E.M??
Mega Light n' Easy Media aka. M.L.E.M started out as a school-project, which was supposed to be perform multiple functions, common social media application would do aswell. *Its just a CRUD application*

## What technologies are used?
It is an Express JS Project, which uses a mongoDb-Cluster as a database

## Does it work?
Define work. So far it's not more than a simpel CRUD application. No security, no deployment, nothing.

## What's the idea behind it?
Actually I would like to implement several features we learned at school into this project, since my motivation is the biggest for this one. Although it could use some CSS aswell, there is a lot to do. I would love to deploy it and maybe implement it on an actual website, but thats future stuff :P

### TODO
--> CSS<br>
--> SSO<br>
--> Make XSS impossible<br>
--> Enable TOTP (may already be implemented, but not 100% right I think)<br>
-->
